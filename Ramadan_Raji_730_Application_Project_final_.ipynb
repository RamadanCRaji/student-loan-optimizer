        "### A Mixed Integer Programming Approach to Minimize Interest Payments\n",

        "## Why I Built This\n",
        "\n",
        "I have student loans. Six of them, actually, totaling over $33,000 with interest rates ranging from 3.76% to 7.94%. Like most students, I was making payments without really knowing if I was doing it the \"right\" way. Should I pay them all equally? Attack the highest balance first? Focus on the highest interest rate?\n",
        "\n",
        "Then I took my Prescriptive Analytics class and learned about optimization modeling. We shifted from a \"data first\" approach to a \"model first, then data\" approach. That's when it clicked: I could use these new skills to solve my own real problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I built this optimizer. It takes my actual loan data, my budget constraints, and figures out the mathematically optimal way to pay off my debt while minimizing total interest paid.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The result?** By following the optimal strategy instead of splitting payments equally, I save **$1,279** in interest. That's **20.7% less interest** with the exact same budget.\n",

        "- Takes in loan balances, interest rates, and budget constraints\n",
        "- Accounts for subsidized vs unsubsidized loans (subsidized loans do not accrue interest while in school)\n",
        "- Handles two budget phases: 400/month while in school, $800/month after graduation\n",
        "- Outputs a quarter-by-quarter payment schedule telling you exactly how much to pay each loan\n",

        "## What I Accomplished\n",
        "\n",
        "I built a Mixed Integer Programming model that optimizes student loan repayment. Using my real loan data from Federal Student Aid, the model determined the optimal payment strategy across 20 quarters (5 years).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Results:**\n",
        "- Total interest paid: **$4,913** (optimal) vs **$6,192** (naive equal split)\n",
        "- Total savings: **$1,279** (20.7% less interest)\n",
        "- Debt-free by: **Q17 (January - March 2030)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The model confirmed what finance experts often recommend: attack high-interest debt first. But it went further by accounting for the fact that my subsidized loans do not accrue interest while I am in school, so every dollar should go toward the unsubsidized loans during that time.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What I Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "This project taught me that optimization is not just an academic exercise. It solves real problems. The shift from \"data first\" to \"model first, then data\" changed how I think about problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also learned that the math behind these models is powerful when combined with domain knowledge. Understanding how federal student loans work (subsidized vs unsubsidized, grace periods, minimum payments) was just as important as knowing how to write constraints in Pyomo.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges I Faced\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scalability:** My first model used monthly periods (60 time steps) and took too long to solve. Switching to quarterly periods (20 time steps) solved in under 1 second.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Nonlinear Constraints:** The minimum payment rule created a nonlinear term. I used Big-M linearization to convert it into a linear constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Solver Setup:** Getting CBC to work in Google Colab required using IDAES extensions to access the solver executable.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Future Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Add income growth scenarios (budget increases over time as salary grows)\n",
        "- Model refinancing decisions (lower rate vs losing federal protections)\n",
        "- Build a web app so anyone can input their loans and get an optimized plan\n",
        "- Add PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) modeling for public sector workers\n",

        "## Final Thoughts\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have student loans, you do not have to guess at the best repayment strategy. With some basic optimization modeling, you can find the mathematically optimal approach for your specific situation.\n",
